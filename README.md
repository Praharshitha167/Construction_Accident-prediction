# Construction_Accident-prediction
This project analyzes construction site accident reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify accident causes and identify common risk factors. The dataset is sourced from OSHA reports.

Tech Stack:
Python, Jupyter Notebook
NLP (Text Mining, Chunking)
Machine Learning (SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes)
Deep Learning (Hybrid Neural Network)
Problem Statement:
Construction sites are prone to frequent accidents, but understanding the root causes is challenging due to unstructured textual data.

Solution:
This project processes and analyzes accident reports, applying NLP and ML models to classify accident causes, achieving an F1 score of 0.813 with a hybrid deep-learning model.

Target Audience:
Construction Safety Teams (for risk assessment)
Regulatory Bodies (for compliance and safety measures)
Data Scientists & Researchers (for NLP-based accident analysis)
