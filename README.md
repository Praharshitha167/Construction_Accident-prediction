# Construction Accident Prediction
Construction Accident Analysis is a machine learning and NLP-based project that analyzes construction site accident reports to classify causes and identify risk factors. Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, NLP (Text Mining, Chunking), Machine Learning (SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes), and Deep Learning (Hybrid Neural Network), the project processes unstructured OSHA reports and achieves an F1 score of 0.813 with a hybrid model.
### Problem Statement
Construction sites frequently experience accidents, but analyzing unstructured textual data to identify root causes remains a challenge.This project extracts meaningful insights from accident reports, helping improve safety measures and risk assessment.
### Target Audience
Construction Safety Teams (for risk assessment), Regulatory Bodies (for compliance and safety improvements), and Data Scientists & Researchers (for NLP-based accident analysis).
